# 📊 Bank Loan Case Analysis| Excel & SQL 

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project analyzes loan application data to identify key factors influencing loan defaults. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Excel, we uncover patterns that help in making data-driven loan approval decisions.  

## 💼 Business Problem  
As a data analyst at a finance company, your goal is to minimize financial risks associated with loan approvals by identifying:  
- **Potential defaulters** based on past payment behavior.  
- **Key risk indicators** that can influence loan approval decisions.  
- **Loan applicants who are financially capable** but might be rejected due to insufficient credit history.  

### 🔹 Challenges Faced by the Company  
1. **Rejecting creditworthy applicants** → Leads to business loss.  
2. **Approving risky applicants** → Results in financial loss.  

### 🔹 Loan Application Outcomes  
- **Approved:** Loan granted.  
- **Cancelled:** Customer withdrew the application.  
- **Refused:** Loan application rejected.  
- **Unused Offer:** Loan approved but not utilized.  

## 🛠️ Data Analysis Approach  

### 1️⃣ Handling Missing Data  
- Identified missing values using **COUNT, ISBLANK, and IF** functions.  
- Dealt with missing data using imputation methods (**AVERAGE, MEDIAN**).   

### 2️⃣ Identifying Outliers  
- Detected outliers using **QUARTILE, IQR, and conditional formatting**.  
- Assessed whether outliers were valid data points or required further action.   

### 3️⃣ Analyzing Data Imbalance  
- Determined class imbalance using **COUNTIF and SUM**.  
- Calculated the ratio of different classes in the dataset.  

### 4️⃣ Univariate, Segmented Univariate, & Bivariate Analysis  
- **Univariate Analysis**: Explored variable distributions.  
- **Segmented Univariate Analysis**: Compared distributions for different scenarios.  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Examined relationships between variables and target outcomes.  

### 5️⃣ Identifying Key Correlations  
- Segmented dataset into different scenarios.  
- Used **CORREL function** to identify top correlations influencing loan defaults.
